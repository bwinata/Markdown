## The Dilemma of Hard Choices ##

In May 2015, I decided to pack my bags and head overseas to work in the States. I was leaving friends, family, routine, familiar surroundings and heading to a place I had never been, not knowing what was going to happen next. Until that point I had traveled quite a bit in my time but never lived abroad, so as you may well imagine coming to this decision was one of the biggest choices I have ever had to make but I'm glad I did and looking back, I don't think I would of had it any other way. I was faced with a hard choice. 

Interestingly, a year prior in May 2014 (maybe it was serendipity), I was brought to the attention of a TED talk given by Ruth Chang. Ruth gave a powerful talk at TEDSalon NY about [How to Make Hard Choices](http://www.ted.com/talks/ruth_chang_how_to_make_hard_choices). It had such an impact on me personally, that I decided to share it with anyone willing to give this piece a read and hopefully help you as it did for me make that hard decision you've been considering for a while. 

Making hard choices is by their nature hard right? But why are they hard and how can you come to a final decision on which choice to make. Well, this is where Ruth comes in. Her logic of making that hard choice is surprisingly simple, but yet effective. 

In her talk, she provides a series of anecdotes about various examples of said choices and provides hypothetical scenarios in which relative increases in the supposed attractiveness of one choice is proposed. From here, she analyses whether that choice (decision) has succeeded in becoming the better option to pursue. This may not make sense to you right now, but we'll go with a simple example to help better explain what Ruth means.

Let's say you have two options you're considering;

1. An offer to take on a new job overseas
2. Staying at your current job

From the two options provided, you can already see the pros and cons of each option. 

*Option 1* carries the risk of leaving your friends and family, a greater cost in moving as well as the chance of your new job not being quite what you anticipated.  However, the option provides an opportunity to travel abroad and experience a new culture, lifestyle and sense of adventure that you wouldn't of considered before.

*Option 2* looks like it's the safer and best option to take at face value. Staying at your current job means security, stability, familiar surroundings and food for thought knowing that you are surrounded by people you know. But the dilemma of this choice is the fact that you probably don't want to stay and are seeking an experience working abroad. The risk in the first choice is high and putting off your decision to move. 

Let's now throw a spanner into the works. Your current boss is now offering you a significant pay rise (option 2). A rise enough to make you reconsider option 2 entirely. Now if we assume both these options are of equal value in terms of what they have to offer and what you have to lose, then rationally speaking, the pay rise should be enough to simplify your choice by deciding to stay at your current job. Decison made! Now, for some people, this would work. But for others, the choices are still difficult and perhaps made even more complicated for a few. Now hang on, we're rational beings - this means our choices should also be rational. If someone incentivises you with something extra then we must choose that better option. But this isn't happening. Why?

Ruth suggests that our goals and aspirations have nothing to do with our rationale as humans. Quantifying our choices is futile and inexact. People make decisions based on two forms of influence; external and internal. 

Those who base their choices solely on external influences are **drifters**. They allow the world to dictate who they become. As Ruth puts it - *"Drifters allow the world to write the story of their lives. They let mechanisms of reward and punishment -- pats on the head, fear, the easiness of an option â€” to determine what they do."* Their decisions are a result of how others are to perceive them. I've definitely been down that path. We all have at some point. 

However, those who choose their decisions based on internal factors define who they become from within themselves. They choose a path that gives them meaning. Who are they to become and what do they want to fulfill?

So what should I take from this? 

Next time you're faced with a hard choice, don't be a drifter. Find reasons from within yourself and choose a path that gives you meaning and ignore what the rest of the world will think. The lesson of hard choices should be embraced and not thought of as a plight on the human conditon. Hard choices are a chance for each of us to demonstrate our freedom of choice and should allow you to make decisions that define who you are as a person and not what the world thinks you should become.
