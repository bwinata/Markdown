## A Tale of my San Francisco Job Hunt ##

**Location** - San Francisco, California.

Finding that new job can sometimes be an easy process for most people, while it can take a fair while for others. For me, I belonged to the latter. The resumes, cover letters, applications, questionaires, phone screens, interviews etc etc etc. was definitely something I wasn't looking forward to but it had to be done. More often than not, companies nowadays utilise a handful of these methods as a means of filtering so if I had any chance of landing anything, it meant that I would have to focus all my efforts on these areas. How I did that? - I'll get to that shortly...

Searching for a new job was one thing but applying for new roles in another country half way around the world was definitely another. Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed what I was doing here in Sydney. Up until March 2015, I had been at my current role for the better part of three years. A well paying job, stable income, relatively easy commute to work, friends and family all around etc. was available. But why? Why put myself through all this hard work not knowing if I could even land a job. For me, I've always maintained the philosophy of not getting too comfortable wherever I am. I love the idea of change. Whether that change ultimately ended in a fashion I had anticipated or not is irrevelant. Change is necessary in all facets of life and for me I had to embrace it fully in order to pursue a venture completely foreign to me. In some manner of speaking, I wanted to find if I could do it myself after reading and knowing a few people who'd done it in the past. It was both an aspirational goal of mine as well as a personal one and I wanted to see how far I could go. 

So for the better part of six months (November 14 - April 15), I decided to hit the job trail once more, and this is how it went...

Elephant in the room...

**1. The Prep**

For a guy like me working in tech, some basic preparation was needed to make sure I was at a level that was employable...whatever that means. Actually, it means quite a lot. Prior to even considering a role in the States, a brush up of my  skills were definitely due for an update. Just to make sure I wasn't wasting my time, I had done quite a bit of research about what the hiring process was all about. 

Here are some quick links I checked out myself in getting started with the whole application process. They were a great help and definitely a must if you want to grab a good insight into the world of the Silicon Valley job hunt;

- [Lessons from a Silicon Valley Job Search](http://robertheaton.com/2014/03/07/lessons-from-a-silicon-valley-job-search/) by Robert Heaton
- [Getting a job in San Francisco](http://blog.penso.info/2013/05/25/getting-a-job-in-san-francisco/) by Fabien Penso

What I found was, well it's fair to say more than I had anticipated - It was time to dust off some of the old lecture notes and hit the books again. It soon became apparent, that tech companies are now becoming more stringent in their hiring practices. They want to know that you're skill set is at a sufficient level of their standard. Google set the trend in its hiring practices and this method has since echoed through most tech companies (especially in the SF Bay Area). 

So what does brushing up mean? Well that really depends on what role you're applying for. Generally speaking, this pretty much involves revising on fundamental knowledge in your field of interest, be it software, hardware, web, big data etc. But personally for me, it meant coming to grips with core concepts of computer science i.e. Fundamental algorithms and data structures as well as electrical engineering i.e. embedded systems, basic circuit and PCB design. 

If you're keen to know a bit more about how to prepare for a technical interview, feel free to check out my article on [Technial Interview Preparation](/home/bwinata/Projects/Blog/Markdown/Misc/2013/07/18/Preparing-for-a-Technical-Interview.md). 

If you're in the software field, here's a few links to get you started;

- [Know Thy Complexities](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)
- [Always Be Coding](https://medium.com/@davidbyttow/abc-always-be-coding-d5f8051afce2)

There are also a bunch of other additional reference materials if you find yourself craving more - [Introduction to Algorithms](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Electrical-Engineering-Computer/dp/0262031418) from MIT is a real gem if you really want to dive into the nitty gritty of complexity analysis or if you simply want a surface level understanding. It's worth a read and pretty much covers everything under the sun regarding algorithms and data structures. 

***Pro Tip***: Practice makes perfect. I can't stress that out enough. If you don't think your skills are up to scratch, then there is no better time to start than now. If you're a "softy", better get cracking on some mock interview questions. Language doesn't really matter, although C/C++, Java, Python would be a good choice. Set up a folder on your computer where you can store all your mock questions. You can get questions from anywhere. Here are some good places to get started;
- [TopCoder](http://www.topcoder.com)
- [Leet Code](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/)
- [Hacking a Google Interview](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/iap/interview/materials.php)
- [Top 10 Algorithm Questions](http://www.programcreek.com/2012/11/top-10-algorithms-for-coding-interview/)
- [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X) (Highly Recommended)

Also, if you're like me, and you're applying for a tech role, be sure to also update your resume accordingly. One page is the standard and make sure to be succinct in your experience and background. You can also bet that before your resume falls upon the eyes of a real person, it will pretty much get pre-screened by an Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). These sneaky bastards will not only suss out your CV for grammatical and spelling errors, but it also looks out for key words specific to the role. So if your resume contains no associations with the role you're applying for or contains errors of any sort, be mindful that'll it probably won't have any chance of seeing the light of day. Remember that your resume is the first gate to you getting that job so it needs to stand out. One resouce that I would personally advocate is Gayle Laakmann McDowell's bestseller book - [The Google Resume](http://www.amazon.com/Google-Resume-Prepare-Microsoft-Company/dp/0470927623/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1430377084&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Google+Resume). It's a perfect resource to help build up your resume. 

***Pro Tip***: Cover letters matter! In this day an age with the power of the web it's super easy to submit your generic resume with a click of a button, sit back and relax until someone gets hold of you. But let this be a lesson to you if you don't hear anything ever! Companies want to know that you're more than just a fancy looking resume. They want to know why you want to work for them and all of this should come in the form a PERSONALISED cover letter. Be mindful to include your interests, passions and aspirations. It lets them know that you're keen and willing to stand out from the rest of the pack.

So there we have it - A decent looking resume and a few cover letters primed for certain companies I had my eye on. It was now time to get in on the hunt and begin the applications.

**2. The Hunt**

Because of my physical location, it made it that much harder to apply for jobs in that area. So I decided to the next best thing - apply for jobs online. 

I decided to apply to as many jobs which suited my area of interest. For those interested, here's a quick list of job portals I had a go at applying through;

- [Glassdoor](http://www.glassdoor.com.au/index.htm)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/job/home?trk=nav_responsive_sub_nav_jobs)
- [Monster](http://www.monster.com/)
- [VentureLoop](http://www.ventureloop.com/ventureloop/home.php)
- [Angel.co](https://angel.co/jobs)
- [CyberCoders](http://www.cybercoders.com/)
- [Beyond](http://www.beyond.com/)

**Note**: Some are better than others, but I'll leave you to be the judge of that. 

For the most part, all of the above were beneficial in some way which gave me a great launch pad to get started, but be mindful that there are a plethora of other ways of applying for that job (which I eventually found out). For example, applying directly to their company website would work. Most of the third-party sites more or less re-direct you to them anyway. Going through third-party recruiters is definitely another. CAUTION: Not all recruiters are helpful. Some are douche bags who don't get back to you for weeks on end, while others are proactive and incredibly helpful - [Job Spring Partners](http://jobspringpartners.com/) is great example of the latter. In any case best to seek recruiters by word of mouth. 

***Pro Tip***: The above methods are good, but they fail miserably in comparison to personal referrals. Referrals are by far the most powerful method of getting your foot in the door. As the old adage typically goes - *"It's not what you know, but who you know".* Network with as many people you can. Attend [meetups](http://meetup.com) in your area, connect with others on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com) or simply chat and introduce yourself to people around you. Your ability to network and commuicate with others is paramount in making that first milestone. Jeff Dunn's [Intel article](http://blogs.intel.com/jobs/2015/05/01/network-for-success/?linkId=13959566) on networking is good a read. 

Whilst applying for jobs, I found that keeping track of all my applications was a bit of a nightmare. It's alright keeping a mental note of 5-10 jobs apps but when you begin applying to 20-40, remembering each and everyone of them will surely turn your brain to scrambled eggs. Keeping a simple spreadsheet or document is a sure fire way to monitor your applications. A few headings should do the trick;

- Position e.g. Hardware engineer
- Company 
- Location e.g. San Francisco
- Status e.g. Applied / Rejected
- Contact (if applicable) i.e. xxx@company.com

As simple as this sounds, I was a bit suprised how infrequent this action actually gets done.

***Pro Tip***: Get in early! If you see a job of interest posted in recent days, your best bet is to apply for it immediately. The quicker you get in, the quicker someone will get back to you albeit you satisify their requirements. 

**3. The Waiting Game**

No matter how many people you connect with, how many jobs you apply for or how good you think you are - there's always a waiting game. For me, it meant applying for jobs in the evening after work and because of the time difference between Sydney and the States, waking up every morning checking my emails for any hint of a reply. Most of the time, my inbox would contain only the usual suspects of junk mail, facebook and twitter updates etc. But from time to time, I would get some emails regarding some interest from a few companies - Boom!! Elated as I was, I knew it was only the beginning. I was happy and flattered that companies even decided to reach out in the first place.

**4. The Process**

 Soon after, I would reply back immediately to set up a time to speak with either their recruiter or their engineers.

 Most tech companies will first conduct a phone screen before they even consider you a potential candidate. Depending on the comapny, your screen (which could be one of many) may include a culture screen as well as a technical, so be sure to get ready beforehand and do as much reasearch about the company and any areas relating to the role you're applying for. Remember - *Failing to prepare, is preparing to fail* or something along those lines.

 ***Pro Tip***: If you are successul in locking an interview, be mindful to set a time and date where you will have enough time to prepare. The excitement of first contact with a recruiter will surely get to you, but be mindful to set out your next moves logically.
