## Landing that New Role - My San Francisco Job Hunt ##

Location - San Francisco, California.

Finding that new job can sometimes be an easy process for most people, while it can take a fair while for others. For me, I belonged to the latter. The resumes, cover letters, applications, questionaires, phone screens, interviews, rejections etc etc etc. was definitely something I wasn't looking forward to but it had to be done. More often than not, companies nowadays utilise a handful of these methods as a means of filtering so if I had any chance of landing anything, it meant that I would have to focus all my efforts on these areas. How I did that? - I'll get to that shortly...

Searching for a new job was one thing but applying for new roles in another country half way around the world was definitely another. Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed what I was doing here in Sydney. Up until March 2015, I had been at my current role for the better part of three years. A well paying job, stable income, relatively easy commute to work, friends and family all around etc. was available. But why? Why put myself through all this hard work not knowing if I could even land a job. For me, I've always maintained the philosophy of not getting too comfortable wherever I am. I love the idea of change. Whether that change ultimately ended in a fashion I had anticipated or not is irrevelant. Change is necessary in all facets of life and for me I had to embrace it fully in order to pursue a venture completely foreign to me. In some manner of speaking, I wanted to find if I could do it myself after reading and knowing a few people who'd done it in the past. It was both an aspirational goal of mine as well as a personal one and I wanted to see how far I could go. 

So for the better part of six months (November 14 - April 15), I decided to hit the job trail once more, and this is how it went...

Elephant in the room...

** The Prep **
For a guy like me working in tech, some basic preparation was needed to make sure I was at a level that was employable...whatever that means. Actually, it means quite a lot. Prior to even considering a role in the States, a brush up of my  skills were definitely due for an update. Just to make sure I wasn't wasting my time, I had done quite a bit of research about what the hiring process was all about. 

What I found was, well it's fair to say more than I had anticipated - It was time to dust off some of the old lecture notes and hit the books again. It soon became apparent, that tech companies are now becoming more stringent in their hiring practices. They want to know that you're skill set is at a sufficient level of their standard. Google set the trend in its hiring practices and this method has since echoed through most tech companies (especially in the SF Bay Area). 

So what does brushing up mean? Well that really depends on what role you're applying for. Generally speaking, this pretty much involves revising on fundamental knowledge in your field of interest, be it software, hardware, web, big data etc. But personally for me, it meant coming to grips with core concepts of computer science i.e. Fundamental algorithms and data structures as well as electrical engineering i.e. embedded systems, basic circuit and PCB design. 

If you're keen to know a bit more about how to prepare for a technical interview, feel free to check out my article on [Technial Interview Preparation](/home/bwinata/Projects/Blog/Markdown/Misc/2013/07/18/Preparing-for-a-Technical-Interview.md). 

If you're in the software field, here's a few links to get you started;

- [Know Thy Complexities](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)
- [Always Be Coding](https://medium.com/@davidbyttow/abc-always-be-coding-d5f8051afce2)

In terms of additional reference materials, there's also [Introduction to Algorithms](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Electrical-Engineering-Computer/dp/0262031418) from MIT if you really want to dive into the nitty gritty. It's worth a read and pretty much covers everything under the sun regarding algorithms and data structures. Another invaluable resource is [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X) by Gayle Laakmaan McDowell (GLM). 

Again, like me, if you're applying for a tech role, be sure to update your resume accordingly. One page only is the standard. Make sure to be succinct in your experience and background. You can also bet that before your resume falls upon the eyes of a real person, it will pretty much get pre-screened by an Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). These sneaky bastards will not only suss out your CV for grammatical and spelling errors, but it also looks out for key words specific to the role. So if your resume contains no associations with the role you're applying for or contains errors of any sort, be mindful that'll it probably won't have any chance of seeing the light of day. Remember that your resume is the first gate to you getting that job so it needs to stand out. One resouce that I would personally advocate is GLM's other bestseller book - [The Google Resume](http://www.amazon.com/Google-Resume-Prepare-Microsoft-Company/dp/0470927623/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1430377084&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Google+Resume). It's a perfect resource to help build up your resume. 

** The Hunt **
Because of my physical location, it made it that much harder to apply for jobs in that area. So I decided to the next best thing - apply for jobs online. 

I decided to apply to as many jobs which suited my area of interest. For those interested, here's a quick list of job portals I had a go at applying through;

- [Glassdoor](http://www.glassdoor.com.au/index.htm)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/job/home?trk=nav_responsive_sub_nav_jobs)
- [Monster](http://www.monster.com/)
- [VentureLoop](http://www.ventureloop.com/ventureloop/home.php)
- [Angel.co](https://angel.co/jobs)
- [CyberCoders](http://www.cybercoders.com/)
- [Beyond](http://www.beyond.com/)

** Note **: Some are better than others, but I'll leave you to be the judge of that. 

For the most part, all of the above were beneficial in some way which gave me a great launch pad to get started, but be mindful that there are a plethora of other ways of applying for that job (which I eventually found out). For example,  applying directly to their company website would work. Most of the third-party site more or less re-direct you to them anyway. So may as well by-pass the middle guy.
