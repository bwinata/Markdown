# Bombay, India #

The traffic, the noise, the smell, the sea breeze and the heat. Welcome to Mumbai.

Mumbai is situated along the west coast of India and is the capital city of the Maharashtra state. The city is arguably the wealthiest and most expensive in all of the country and is well known for being the home to the glamour, lights, action and kaleidoscopic talent that is Bollywood. In addition, Mumbai, or formerly Bombay is home to 20 million souls - the most populous city in India. Bombay delivers a truly eclectic mix of people, culture and religion. From being home to Asia's biggest slum to housing the world's most expensive home, it really is a tale of two cities.

Stepping out of the airport in the middle of January, supposedly India's coolest month, you're immediately greeted with glaring sun, sizzling heat, bustling noise and the ubiquitous taxi drivers seeking your foreign money. Amazing! If you do find yourself in this position, the best thing you can do is stay calm and dutifully ignore and waive off any people who don't belong to the airport transport services...courteously of course. Your best bet is to head over to the official prepaid taxi service desk located at the exit gate (domestic / intl). The guys there will set you up with a proper taxi and take you to your accommodation or wherever you want to go. In a place like Mumbai, you've gotta have your wits about you and to trust your guts at the end of the day.

When seeking out places to stay, be mindful of the location and available transport. Personally, two places I stayed include; [Hotel Midland](http://www.hotelmidland.com/) and the [Hotel Golden Swan](http://www.goldenswan.com/hgs/html/index.html). Both places reside in the heart of the Santacruz district in the center of the city. With decent facilities and attentive staff, you actually do get your money's worth, starting from $AUD 30 per night.You're probably doing your research right now, scoping out places to see and you'll find that this is isn't anywhere near any those sites! But it's very likely that they're the classic tourist hot spots - Gateway of India right? Don't get me wrong, you've gotta do the norm when it comes to India, but if you really want to experience the real Mumbai, Santacruz is the place to be. The street stalls align the bustling roads every night, the anthemic sounds of honking Tuk tuks and the smell of the city streets is enough to visit the area while you're there. Now if you do decide to stay a little closer to everything else, be mindful that costs will definitely be on the rise. Although I would like to stay at the Taj Palace one day...

Okay, here we go! Let's get out of the hotel and into the city. Transport wise, there are two main ways you can get around - a Tuk Tuk (rickshaw) or a cab. If you're of a more rounded person, take the train or the bus. It's great! Seriously. There's nothing like catching public transport in a foreign country and grabbing a taste of the way the locals live every day. Public transport is always fun and cheap. Alternatively a Tuk Tuk will set you back around a 10 rupees / km (20 cents), while a cab (depending on what type you choose) will lighten your pockets by 100 rupees / km on average. Now, about cabs, just walking around, you'll begin to see two types - blue / white (aircon) and black / yellow (no aircon). Personally, I would prefer to take bumblebee (get it!?) seeing as I'm tight when it comes to money, but I also do enjoy rolling down the windows soaking in the fresh sea air. And one more thing about Tuk Tuks, be sure that they're metered, apparently by law.

Where to go? Now, I'm not going to provide an exhaustive list of things to see and do, but be mindful that you never know what you might find. So just throw caution to the wind and immerse yourself in the city. Speak with locals (those who're not trying to rip you off) and other travelers and see what's available. Here is just a few;

**1.  Juhu Beach**

Let's start from the top. Juhu Beach is located to the north of Santacruz and only a 10 minute ride. The beach is pretty long, with locals packing the nearby food stalls, couples walking along the shore, a stream of kites gliding through the sky and families enjoying the sea breeze. You'll find the beach busy even during midnights, and who can blame them when the average annual temperature for the city is 30 degrees. And oh yeah, be very weary when approaching the food kiosks and don't mind the casual tug from the local restaurateurs persuading you to enjoy a little bite. The food is genuinely tasty, so look around and be sure to waive off approaches courteously.

**2. Bandra West**

Moving south, just past Santacruz, you'll arrive at the famous Bandra district, where you'll mostly likely spot a face you'll probably miss, but the locals will identify with immediately from tv, music or the movies. More specifically, Bandra West provides a classic example of what it's like to be rich and wealthy in India. With well known brands lining the major roads, shops housing electronics, sporting apparel and designer clothing, you'll probably think you're back home. Linking road, or anywhere around there is probably the place to be. Over here, you'll probably find more tourists than anywhere else in the city. Go figure.

**4. Marine Drive / Chowpatty Beach**

Onwards! So this one will definitely require anything else but a Tuk Tuk. The trouble is that if you're coming from the top of Mumbai to the bottom, rickshaws won't give you a second look because it's just too damn far . In this instance, I've always taken the taxi down to Marine Drive. If you do find yourself coming from the north, the driver will probably ask you to choose between two specific routes; Sea Link or no Sea Link. If it's your first time in Mumbai, take the former. It's an amazing construction that takes you from one side of the bay to the other. It's also quicker as well!

![Image - Chowpatty Beach](https://jnbblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/mg_8767.jpg? "Bombay - Chowpatty Beach") 

Once you've reached the other side, stop over at Chowpatty beach. You'll probably hear more about this beach than Juhu, but it equally remarkable and different in its own right. Resting on the banks of Marine drive, it is definitely worth walking along the beach / drive watching kids play a game of soccer or cricket, the flat bay bathing in the sunlight and the aliveness of the adjacent chaotic drive. Because the city is positioned on the west coast, it does give you a real opportunity to witness a sunset, so come by during the evening. You'll be inundated with couples doing the same thing.

**5. Colaba**

Okay this is the big one. Let's say you're in Chowpatty, I do encourage you to actually walk along Marine down to Colaba. I think by this time you've had enough of being driven around or maybe you don't. But anyhow, get some exercise and enjoy a stroll. The drive itself does span around 3km, so if you do get tired just hop onto anything that comes your way. Don't worry they'll come to you..

Grab a map of the city or use your phone's GPS if available. If you do find yourself lost, again find some transport whatever it is and tell the driver to take you to the Gateway of India. Yes I know, the good ol' tourist trap. But you know what, it's a great reference point to start exploring the area. When you do arrive at the gate, it's the airport all over again. Be mindful, watch your belongings and ignore any approaches from those willing to take a photo of you in front of the gate.

Once you've finished the gate, there a few places to check out from here. Just a 5 minute walk, you'll end up at the world famous Leopolds Cafe (Google will tell you why) where you can grab a cool drink or a bite to eat. It's probably the only place in Mumbai where you'll see more foreign faces then locals for one good reason - Shantaram! But I'll get to that later.

Moving on, if you're in the need of a little appreciation, head down to Dhobi Ghat where they have the world's largest outdoor laundromat, where you'll witness the locals performing their local washing routines.

![Image - The Oval Maiden](https://jnbblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/mg_8740.jpg "Bombay - The Oval Maiden") 

Head back to the gate and journey upwards for a few minutes until you end up in the central area of Colaba. Look out for the famous Oval Maiden. Grab a drink and sit on the grass where you'll find 10 or more games of cricket held at any given time.

Hop onto a Tuk tuk and head back along marine drive to the incredible Haji Ali Dargah Mosque. Enough said.

For those who do enjoy a little shopping, Mumbai houses some of the best street markets which are just about everywhere and also the most expensive shopping centers. The High Street Phoenix complex will be sure to put a dent in your pocket by the time you're finished. But hey, it's still cheaper than back home.

Finally, what's this talk about Shantaram? It's a amazing book about some guy who does some stuff in Mumbai...you know what, just get it! Whether you read the book before or after you travel here, you'll definitely have a greater appreciation of what Mumbai has to offer. The city is full of life, culture and religion. Let yourself go and travel with the wind. Do everything and anything you can because this city just keeps on giving! Enjoy!
