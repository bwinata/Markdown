#Agra, India#

Welcome to the city of Agra - Taj Mahal anyone?

If you haven't been to Agra and seen the Taj Mahal, well then you haven't seen India. Interestingly enough, that's the view a lot of travelers have when they come to India, and as a result, Agra over the years has become one of those cities which has made its way to the top of the itinerary list for both local and foreign travelers. People who do visit this city, pass through as a layover staying not more than a couple of days as they make their way onto other cities or like me, make a weekend trip of it from neighbouring cities like Delhi. But for whatever reason, it's definitely a city to visit at least once.

Agra is situated just 200km south east of Delhi - a stone's throw away really. With the city belonging to the so called Golden Triangle, with Delhi and Jaipur being the other two cities, travelers can make short trips down to Agra.

While Agra is accessible by both air and road, the predominant mode of transport getting into the city is by rail which is frankly both affordable and convenient. From Delhi, depending on what train you choose, a normal travel time would be around 3 hours. Tickets to Agra can be purchased at the railway station or via cleartrip. Make sure to setup an account and to confirm your seating arrangements.

**Warning** - Best advice is to never ever be on the waiting list but to ensure your seats have been reserved under your name. Failing to do so could mean that you're not eligible to travel or may have to stand up and get re-allocated to another class. Booking early prevents any of this from happening.

The map below unfortunately doesn't show a train route, but is very similar with the provided drive.

If coming from Delhi, expect Agra to provide an identical climate.

When you finally arrive at Agra station, make your way to the front where you'll be received by taxi and tuk-tuk drivers and perhaps even random locals offering you transport for a good price. If available, inquire with your accommodation about a transfer service - it'll save you a lot of hassle. For me, I made my way on tuk-tuk into the city center paying around 100 rupees. Expect not to pay any higher.

If your intention is to see the Taj and it most likely will be, it would always be best to stay as close as possible to the monument. A great place to stay is the [Hotel Kamal](http://www.hotelkamal.com/), only a short 5 minute walk from the southern gate.

Staff are attentive, prices are more than reasonable and you're welcomed with a pretty damn good view of the mausoleum on its restaurant rooftop.

You're all settled in and it's now time to explore. If making your way to the Taj Mahal, access is provided at three points - west, south and east. Tickets can be purchased at either gates. Bear in mind that typically the south gate will be the most crowded by both locals and foreigners. Now, if you're not a local apparently you do get preferential access albeit with a slightly higher ticket price - around 750 rupees. Indian nationals pay a considerably lower price.

Upon entry of either gate, the famous white marble comes into view and to be honest you're actually quite taken back by its size, architecture and overall splendour. Growing up, seeing images of the mausoleum you really don't appreciate its beauty until you're standing directly in front it.

With no time limit, spend a bit of time making your way around the mausoleum and finally finish off within its interiors. The line getting in is quite long so be prepared to wait. Also, because you'll be stepping onto the marble itself, shoes are not permitted and if not already provided at the gate, make sure you get yourself a pair of plastic foot sleeves.

Once you're finished with the mausoleum, head on out and grab a bite to eat. With so much food around, you definitely won't be short on choices. Staying at Hotel Kamal, their rooftop restaurant serves up pretty good dishes which are both cheap and tasty. Alternatively, check out the very popular Sankara Vegis Restaurant for having amazing vegetarian dishes and a warm and welcoming atmosphere. Here, you're mostly like to be served by the owner himself (Sankara).

Well that's it! You've seen and done everything there is to do in Agra right? Actually, if time permits, head onto another site that I reckon is as good as the Taj itself - Agra Fort. My previous Delhi post talks of the Red Fort and very much, the fort in Agra is of similar nature. Again, hoards of tourist buses will be on the horizon so be prepared to mingle with everyone and anyone.

Entry is 300 rupees per head for foreigners. The fort itself is grand and requires a bit of walking around to take it all in, but it's definitely worth the trip. As you would of probably noticed by now, the city is well known for its marble. So if you're in the mood for some shopping, a good place is Sadar Bazar, just a few kilometers outside of the main center with plenty of things on offer.

Agra is an incredible city which should not be missed whilst in India. Spending even a single day here can make all the difference to your journey after seeing and experiencing another side to India's incredible history.
