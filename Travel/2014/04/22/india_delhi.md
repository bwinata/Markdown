# Delhi, India #

Welcome to the state capital of India - Delhi!

Delhi is one of those mega cities you need to visit at least once. With a population of around 22 million, the city meticulously encapsulates the transitional aspects of its history from the days of the old Mughal empire and British colonialism to modern day India. With such a city now being on the frontline of the 21st century, there's no doubt that Delhi will, if not already be a global mega city for years to come.

The city resides in the state of Uttar Pradesh positioned in the central upper area of the region. Home to the country's parliament, embassies, high commissions and other government bodies, Delhi delivers a great opportunity to explore its political district. Additionally, it provides a great introduction into the country's heritage and culture through museums, religious sites and historical monuments. And like all big cities, it comes with the all too familiar material scene with the city housing some of the country's biggest shopping centres.

With quite a bit to see and do, try to give yourself a couple of days to explore the city. As Delhi operates one of the biggest airports in the country, many travelers often include the city in their layovers with most of the major airlines passing through here on their way to Europe, the Middle East, the rest of Asia and the Asia-Pacific.

Landing at the airport, if you haven't already organised road transport, make your way to the closest [metro](http://www.delhimetrorail.com/zoom-route-map.aspx) station e.g. Delhi Aero City station on the orange line. From here, you can make your way to pretty much anywhere in the city. Alternatively, Delhi is also accessible by bus and train. If arriving by the latter, you'll most probably end up at one the city's intercity train stations - Delhi, New Delhi, Nizamuddin etc. From here you can grab a taxi, tuk tuk or catch the local metro to wherever you want to go.

Seeking accommodation, your best bet is to stay close to the heart of the city where most of the sites and attractions are located - India Gate, Connaught Place, Parliament etc. The [Delhi metro station](http://www.delhimetrorail.com/zoom-route-map.aspx) is unlike anything else you'll mostly probably come across in the country. Train arrivals are punctual, stations are clean and more or less ordered. If you've ever been to Singapore, expect the same in Delhi. As surprising as it may be, the city really got its act together ever since the Commonwealth games and it definitely comes through in their public transport. With spitting and littering prohibited on the metro, the government has really enforced a tourist friendly environment. And with that, getting started in Delhi can be as easy as hopping onto a train. Don't get too confused or stressed out on what do. A little bit of research can go a long way in this city. Here are just few things to get you started;

**1. India Gate**

Alright lets start off with the very classic hot spot that will see you get inundated with the locals trying to sell you everything under the sun. Despite the unfortunate hoards of tourists flocking to this place, the gate itself is quite a significant monument that marks India's modern history. The gate is a tribute and memorial to the fallen soldiers of the various conflicts the country has been apart of, predominantly World War I. With the names of the soldiers inscribed onto the structure, it's a must see for anyone interested and intrigued by India's past history under British reign.

The monument's position in the city is also quite unique. Because this part of the city is planned, the gate is strategically located in the heart of Delhi's political district, directly facing the presidential palace. As such, the roads are typically closed off to traffic most days and are wide enough to accommodate four or more lanes of traffic. You therefore get this very open area not typically seen anywhere else in the country.

<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d28020.496509209217!2d77.22951!3d28.612912!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0x717971125923e5d!2sIndia+Gate!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sau!4v1428796823988" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0"></iframe>

Getting here is as easy as getting off at the Central Secratariat metro station and taking the appropriate exit. Stepping outside, you'll immediately find the gate to make your own way there. Don't be too surprised as you'll most likely receive offers of cheap tuk tuk (electric!) rides to the monument on your walk. However, best to ignore and be on your way as it's not by any means a huge distance.

**2. Parliament**

If the political scene is your thing, Delhi provides people access to various sections of its political district. The map above shows parliament located on the opposite side of the India Gate which you should check out if in the area.

Just by walking around you'll be amazed at how much open area has been allocated to this district. Certain roads more or less have a few cars at any given time, which is such a contrast to the rest of the city.  It really does go to show that the government has gone to extreme measures in demonstrating the significance of this area to not only the state, but the country and its people.

Photos are generally permitted, but always ask a guard or officer for permission if in doubt.

**3. Red Fort**

When in town, a trip up north of the city will take you to the famous Red Fort, built during the days of the Mughal Empire as the principal residence of its leaders. The fort is located in the Chandni Chowk district, in close proximity to Jama Masjid. With a only a limited window of time, Red Fort unfortunately didn't make my itinerary, but friends have definitely suggested it as a must do. The evening light show however doesn't offer any real surprises of amazement, or so I've heard. Only one way to find out I guess. Also, obviously with being such a high profile tourist spot, expect to get the usual long entry line by both locals and foreigners as well as the general swarm of merchants enticing you to buy everything they have on offer.  But hey, it's all part of the package. It's also very likely that if you have already been, or intend to go to Agra for the majestic Taj Mahal, talk of another very similar complex - Agra Fort, will no doubt have come your way. Both are equally interesting, crowded  and historically significant, so either check one out or the other. It'll definitely save you a lot of time, effort and money.

**4. Jama Masjid**

As mentioned previously, if you're checking out the Red Fort or generally in the area of Chandni Chowk, take a stroll down to Jama Masjid - the most well known and largest mosque in India.

Getting here is only a short walk from Chawri Bazar metro station. Taking a stroll also provides you the opportunity to get a feel of Old Delhi. Here, roads are winding and small lane ways and corridors are prolific. The image below shows the main road leading to the mosque. You really do get a feel of the contrast between New and Old Delhi once you've seen both sides.

As you slowly approach the complex, you'll realise that the architecture of the complex is quite incredible, where access to the courtyard can be gained at three points - north, south and east. Bear in mind to take your shoes off before entering the premises as a sign of respect.

**Warning**: If you are a foreigner, you'll be sure to attract attention, unwanted or not. Now, if you're seen carrying a camera, expect that a local who will claim to be from the mosque approach you asking whether you have permission to take photos and will request to show whether you have paid the camera fee or not. Unfortunately, there is indeed a fee of around 200 rupees, so expect not to pay any higher than this amount. You'll in return receive a ticket indicating your payment. Entry into the mosque however is entirely free so stand your ground if people request otherwise. Another thing to look out for is when paying the camera fee, the payee or their friend may offer you to take you on a guided tour of the complex. Bear in mind that this is NOT free and they will request payment in the end.

At the end of the day, the mosque is a beautiful building which should be visited if time permits irrespective of your religion.

**5. Raj Ghat (Gandhi Memorial)**

If you only have a very limited time in Delhi, I would definitely recommend that you visit the Gandhi memorial center more than anything else in the city. The center is home to the site where the late Mahatma was cremated. Walking around the center delivers a melancholy atmosphere and really makes you appreciate the impact the man had on the country and its people. With so much reverence surrounding him, his importance is reflected in his appearance on every denominational note of the country's currency.

With no metro stations within walking distance, the best option would be to either grab a train to Rajiv Chowk or Chawri Bazar and grab a tuk tuk from there.

**7. Bazaars | Connaught Place | Malls | Dili Haat**

Okay. If buying things and spending money on services i.e. metro, food etc. has not already demonstrated, shopping can be quite attractive in India. However don't be fooled and presume that everything in Delhi is cheap because depending on where you are, certain things are as pricey and perhaps even more expensive than back home.

For really dirt cheap items, ranging from watches, belts and clothing to sporting equipment and electronics, bazaars are definitely the place to check out. If you're ever in Rajiv Chowk, be sure to check out the famous [Palikar Bazaar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palika_Bazaar) situated right next to the metro. Simply, a Bazaar is the term given to a marketplace used predominantly in Asia and the Middle East. Here, you can find everything and anything you ever want. Palikar is underground, however others are typically open-air markets. If close by to Jama Masjid, Meena Bazaar is another one to hit up, positioned at the eastern gate of the mosque. A bit of digging around will give you a number of street markets to explore around the city.

If Bazaars aren't your thing, Rajiv Chowk metro is placed right in the center of the famous Connaught Place - Delhi's central business district. It's famous ring road is home to some of India's biggest firms as well as to the major up-market western brands. For obvious reasons, this place is popular to foreigners and the city's affluent citizens. Navigating is pretty simple - just walk around, and you'll end up where you started.  For more of the same thing, head all the way down to Gurgaon and make your way to Ambience Mall. Stop off at HUDA City center or IFFCO Chowk and catch either a cab or a tuk tuk. With so many shopping centers to choose from, Ambience is supposedly Delhi's longest shopping mall. So if you're ever missing home or want to indulge on western food, then take a pick and enjoy.

Now, if you're in the need of any arts and crafts and seeking genuine products - Dilli Haat is the place to be. Dilli Haat is an open-air bazaar that gains its status from the genuine products it offers predominantly to foreigners. The items themselves are regulated which attempts to mitigate fraud and collusive pricing. The market is based opposite INA market, with only a short 5-10 minute walk from INA station. Entrance incurs a fee of 2o rupees. Despite being targeted at the cashed-up tourists, the market is actually quite affordable and its products are of good quality. Souvenir shopping anyone?

There you have it - Delhi in a nutshell. The list provided is not exhaustive by any means, but hopefully is enough to get you started for those on either a layover or staying longer. Delhi is an amazing mega city that keeps on growing that provides an eclectic mix of history and culture, and is a city that truly offers a harmony between the old and the new.
