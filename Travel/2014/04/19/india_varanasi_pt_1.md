# Varanasi, India - Part One #

Arguably the most religious and oldest city in the world.

Without a doubt, this city is truly one of the greatest places I have ever traveled to and explored. If this city does not blow your mind, then you have no soul. As corny as that may sound, if India has not made an impression on you just yet, after leaving Varanasi, it definitely will.

This amazing city is located in the central upper eastern region of the country and resides in the state of Uttar Pradesh with its location prime for people to journey to from nearby cities such as Delhi. Every year, hundreds of thousands of pilgrims and tourists flock to this place either by plane, train or bus. Don't be surprised if you see the country's own citizens exploring as you do. As one of the holiest cities in India, people from every walk of life arrive looking for a sense of spiritual awakening or simply come to see what it's all about and hopefully walk away with a sense of fulfillment. Nestled along the famous Ganges (Gangas) river, you'll slowly begin to find out why this place is so revered and perhaps life changing for some people.

With so many places to explore around India, Varanasi doesn't have that usual connotation that the other mega cities typically possess, whether it be Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata etc. And this is very a good thing. The city shuns away from the spotlight and up to this very day still manages to purify itself from the external influences of a changing and growing modern society.

With its position more further north from the equator, Varanasi produces a climate that is more in line with the four seasons. During January, expect to bring decent clothing to prepare for cold nights and early mornings, with the temperature hovering around 10-20 degrees on most days. June is a completely different story, so adequately hydrate yourself during this period.

As mentioned previously, Varanasi is accessible by all modes of transport - car, train, bus or plane. If arriving by bus or train, remember to book your trip much in advance as tickets can sell out pretty quickly all year round by both locals and foreigners. A great site to checkout and reserve all your transport needs is [cleartrip](http://www.cleartrip.com/). For trains and buses, be sure to secure your seat and NOT be placed in the waiting line. The latter could either mean you're not eligible to travel at all or it may mean that you might end up standing up in a lower class. And this is something you definitely want to avoid for a 10 hour trip. So again, book in advance. For me, I was flying into Varanasi from Mumbai, so it made sense to catch a flight in order to save time and have more of an opportunity to explore the city. But don't get me wrong, if an opportunity comes your way to take the other transport modes - do it! I did it to Agra from Delhi and it's an incredible experience.

Arriving at the airport, I was quite taken aback by the shear size and cleanliness of the complex. With the amount of visitors to this place, you really do understand why the local government has taken great measures in the city's infrastructure.

The airport itself isn't really well positioned in the heart of the city. It's around a 30 - 60 minute drive (depending on traffic) into the city center. If you have accommodation booked, inquire before arriving about whether a taxi or car service can be arranged beforehand. The last thing you want to do is worry about hassling with taxi drivers or even random locals offering you a lift.

At this point, if you haven't been driven around in a country like India, be prepared to get shuffled around quite a bit. With very little traffic regulations, you'll see some pretty interesting things along the drive, from the ubiquitous trucks swerving between lanes and cars on the wrong side of the road to animal pedestrians (cows, goats etc.) crossing the road. Additionally, you have the chance to see quite a bit of the rural parts of the country and really appreciate the different lifestyle and infrastructure between the city and the countryside. As you gradually approach the city, you'll begin to find out that it's actually very busy and loud, during both the day and night, contrary to what you hear about and see of Varanasi - peaceful, serene, calm etc. But don't worry,  it's all good, you'll get to that later.

If you intend on staying on the bank of the Ganges, you're not alone! Almost every foreign traveler will be in your boat (see what I did there). Anyway, the most populous and obviously more expensive places will be near the temples and burning ghats, but if you don't mind taking a 10 - 15 minute stroll, it would be worth while checking out [Welcome Inn at Ganges](http://www.welcomeinnatganges.com/). It's still on the banks but relatively further away from the famous sites. But hey, grab some exercise and walk through the narrow streets of the neighbourhoods and experience how the locals go about their day-day lives.

**Ghats**

It's now time to venture out and explore the real side of the city, you know, the peaceful and relaxing side that all those pictures have shown you and all those marvelous things your friends have told you about. Now, if you do in fact stay at Welcome Inn at Ganges, there's a few routes you can take to make your way up to the famous ghats. See map. Simply put, a ghat is a flight of stairs perched on the side of a body of water i.e. river.

The first cab of the rank is Assi Ghat, with many travelers beginning their city exploration at this point. While depending where you stay, this may not be the best starting point for everyone, so in any case, just head down to the river and make your way from there.

With so many things to see along the banks, it would be wise not to rush any of it. Best to start in the early morning and maybe even catch a boat ride. As you begin to walk along the ghats, you'll find the locals bathing, washing their clothes, street vendors opening shop for the day selling everything from trinkets, jewellery and paintings to breakfast and massages.

As you continue to walk, sooner or later you'll begin to smell and see plumes of smoke emanating from specific ghats. At this point, you have just stumbled upon one of the most important rituals in Hinduism - cremation. If you're not squeamish, feel free to witness bodies being taken down from the city streets to the banks as the locals make preparations. Depending on the site, there could be around 5 - 10 bodies at any given time. The entire process can take up to 3 hours to cremate the body.  It is truly an amazing site to visit.

**Warning**: As a gesture of respect, no photos or video should be taken within this area that clearly identifies the body. Bear in mind that the deceased relatives will most likely be present. The last thing you want to do is to grab attention as a foreigner during such a sensitive and religious ritual. The photo below was taken at a distance located at the Big Burning (BB) ghat.

Despite the bank being only a few kilometers long, you'll soon realise that a lot more time is required in order to really appreciate this area. Remember to give yourself plenty of time, preferably one full day between dawn to dusk to explore. Another day could be used to explore the city streets. Here are just some photos taken that will hopefully inspire.

Evening has just settled in. Now, if you do get a chance to hang around this area during this time, you're definitely not to miss the daily ritual (Aarti) performed every night between 6:15 - 7:00pm. The ritual forms part of the their prayer (Puja) in which they offer their prayers to the deities. The event is primarily located at the Dashashwamedh ghat and involves a procession of worshipers chanting along with the lighting of several lamps. Also, you'll most likely witness the flow down of hundreds of candle lit Aartis along the Gangas set off by locals and foreigners. Feel free to give it a go but don't be fooled into paying anything that seems ridiculous. There will always be swindlers out there. In any case, the entire process is incredible and meticulous and will definitely demonstrate how powerful religion is in this part of the world.

As mentioned before, you can always hire a boat to take you out during this time, but obviously shop around for the best price. However, no matter where you are, it's definitely worth catching at least once while you're in Varanasi.

As a result of the already long post and not having entirely covered the city just yet, I'm going to leave it here for now and break this post up into two parts. The next post (Varanasi, India - Part 2) will primarily cover old Varanasi where you'll travel back in time and get the chance to navigate through the ancient and narrow streets of the city.
