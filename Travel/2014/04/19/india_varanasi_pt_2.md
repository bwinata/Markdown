# Varanasi, India - Part Two #

If you haven't already done so, check out my previous post on Varanasi (Part 1), where I talk about the famous ghats along the Gangas river.

**Old Varanasi**

Now, if you happen to have some extra time on your hands, another side of the city to explore is the ancient streets of Old Varanasi. With such close proximity to the nearby ghats and river, convenience will definitely be in your favour. Again, like the ghats, exploring this part of the city can take a while, so give yourself ample time. Additionally, getting lost here is not at all uncommon. When in this position, just ask a local or fellow traveler for assistance. Alternatively, finding your way down to the river will always work.

Beginning the journey, you can pretty much start anywhere. Best to make your way to any of the ghats and ascend up the stairs. From here, you'll soon enough begin to lose sight of the water and start to surround yourself by walls on either side.

One of the amazing things you'll notice is that until today, these streets are still being used by locals in their daily lives. Certain areas will have street vendors lining the walls selling snacks, kids playing, merchants selling everything under the sun and worshipers leaving or entering temples. While others may be completely deserted.

If you're in the mood for some shopping, definitely check out some of the many apparel shops embedded along the street walls. You're bound to find something that will catch your eye that is both real and inexpensive. Silk, cashmere and pashmina are extremely sought after here for their affordability. So yes, get it here because anywhere else in India will mostly likely have their stocks imported from Varanasi in the first place.

With so much to see, take your time wandering the lane ways because you really don't know what you'll find.

*Anything else...**

Unfortunately I spent only three days here, however if time permits, you need to hit up their university campus - Banaras Hindu University (BHU). With the main campus spreading over 5.3 square kilometers, it is one of the biggest colleges in the world. Again, because of its shear size, give yourself enough time to check it out.

Another site to also hit up is Sarnath. This region is famous for which Buddha himself gave the first teaching of Dharma. The area is located around 13 kilometers north-east from the city center. Transport wise, inquiring with your accommodation could provide you with the best way to get there.

With so much to give, Varanasi is truly a city that will take you back in time.Religion still plays a very meaningful role for the people of the city and the river Gangas very much adds to that spirituality. To the people of not only the city but the country, this river washes everything away and is the very reason why it plays a significant role in their lives. It's soul is still very much left in tact and hopefully like me, will inspire and help you develop a new perspective on life for the better.
