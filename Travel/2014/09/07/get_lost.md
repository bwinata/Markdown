#Get Lost!#

With so many amazing places to see and so many things to do in our world, traveling can deliver such an overwhelming, rewarding and fulfilling experience. But with so many travelers now taking the road most traveled, more often than not, the only experiences you get is coming home with a little less in your pocket from the overpriced souvenirs you purchased to the insanely priced food dishes from the ubiquitous touristy restaurants lining that famous road you read about in that travel book so highly recommended.

Let’s get one thing straight here; if you’re a tourist – by my guest. But if you’re a traveler, a true adventurer – throw caution to the wind, be spontaneous, get lost and head down that path less taken because you’ll never know what you’ll find and the people you’ll meet.

Don’t get me wrong – seeing that famous statue, walking down that world renown road, walking up those historical steps and eating at that quintessential restaurant are all great things you should do whilst traveling. They’re famous for a reason. But don’t let the ease of your guidebook dictate your path. Traveling should be so much more than what you can easily find down the street from your hotel but simply a yearning to immerse yourself in a place as if you were a local.

The whole notion of traveling is to explore the unexplored. So head down that narrow lane, turn left instead of right, head up those flights of stairs, head into that restaurant filled with locals, eat that meat on a stick you had your eyes locked onto from that street vendor and walk as far as your legs can take you.

Here a just a few tips to get you started.

**Walk**

Some of the most incredible places you’ll come across will be on foot. It gets pretty difficult to venture down an alleyway when you’re on a bus or in a car. If you’re in a place with things packed tightly together, grab some exercise and start walking. Going for a walk allows you to obtain a better perspective of your surroundings along in stimulating all your five senses. It really does bring you to a new level of experience.

**Don’t Panic**

 More often than not, you’ll most likely find yourself in unpredictable surroundings. No other sightings of fellow travelers, strange looks from the locals and a language uncommon to your own are just a few examples. But in any case, the first hint of any uncomfortableness should be challenged with a thought of calmness. Being able to keep calm is a great trait to have on your travels. If you don’t know where you’re going, make it look like you do know, and trust your instincts. Best is to take a deep breath and carefully assess where you need to go and use whatever you have on your person to assist you.

**Ask questions**

Asking questions is definitely a sure fire way to help you along the way, wherever you want to get to. Of course language barriers can present themselves depending where you are, but I found that just using simple gestures i.e. pointing can be surprisingly helpful. I also find that talking to people opens up a whole new dialogue you never had before. And it may just be the case that you hear about new and other gems you would have never stumbled across from any guidebook. Never underestimate the power of word of mouth.

**Instincts**

At the end of your day, you need to have your wits about you. If it’s late at night, don’t walk down an empty lane, don’t follow people you who may look suspicious. Going off the beaten track can be rewarding provided you trust your instincts.

**Smile**

Enough said.

So what are you waiting for? Get out there and see the world for what it truly is and immerse yourself in local cuisine, culture and tradition. You’ll never know what you will find.
