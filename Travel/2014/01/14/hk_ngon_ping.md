# Ngong Ping, Hong Kong #

The Tian Tan Buddha, also known as the Big Buddha, is located at Ngong Ping, Lantau Island, in Hong Kong. Erected in 1993, it is 34 metres high, and is one of the major tourist attractions on the island. It's also 7381 km away from home, according to this sign.

We caught the MTR to Tung Chung station, and were planning to take the Ngong Ping cable car towards Ngong Ping Village which is within walking distance of the Big Buddha.

When we arrived at Tung Chung Town Centre, we found that the line for the cable car was busy, and we were told that there would be over an hour's wait. Instead, we decided to catch a bus (which was immediately available) - Route 23 (Tung Chung - Ngong Ping, ~30 minutes). The bus fare is HK $17.20 on weekdays and Saturdays, and HK $27.00 on Sundays and Public Holidays.

There are 268 stairs leading up to the Big Buddha, which sits on a "lotus" platform. I won't lie, I was pretty intimidated just looking at the stairs. But we managed to get up to the platform eventually, where we had a good look in and around the Big Buddha.

After we walked down to ground level, we decided to have a look around the Po Lin Monastery, which at the time was under renovation.

We then caught the Route 21 bus to Tai-O. Alternative ways back to the city include the Ngong Ping Cable Car, or the Route 23 bus which both lead back to Tung Chung MTR station, where you can catch the train back to the city.
