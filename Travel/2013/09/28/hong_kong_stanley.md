If you've ever been to Hong Kong, or have never have been before, you'll soon realise, if not already that this place is known for its bustling city life, hoards of people moving about and congested streets. I'm guessing that you also have the perception of Hong Kong as being one of Asia's premier financial hubs, impressed upon by money, power and consumerism. And you know what, in all cases you're right.

But it's also important to note that Hong Kong also provides another side, a more calm and laid back side compared to it's better known other half. About an hour bus ride south from Central on Hong Kong island, you'll make it to a series of hotspots located on the south east peninsula. I'm talking about Stanley, part of the Southern District.

If you're ever in the mood for some nice coffee, lunch, a nice tan or just to get away from the madness of it all, this is the place to be. It's a nice little area where you can spend your day drinking coffee, explore the famous Stanley markets, or simply walk about the promenade and enjoy the sunshine. If you want to give your legs a workout, make sure to check out "Ma Hang Park" - a modern and clean park with a great vantage point adjacent to Stanley Plaza - some brilliant views to capture while you're there.

I don't know about you, but when we there, it felt like it wasn't Hong Kong at all. You somehow think that you've been transported to a seaside town on the stretches of the Mediterranean. Simple walking along the streets and paths, you'll begin to notice that there are quite a lot of expats living in this area, along with the occasional swarm of tourists who flood to this area all year round. But don't be deterred by that, it's not insane compared to the common parts of Hong Kong.

We also advise, while down there, get a chance to explore the other parts of the area. The world famous Repulse Bay is just down the road (well sort of), to east of Stanley, simply catch a bus from the depot you arrived. With a swag of beaches in this area, it's pretty damn hard to believe that you're in Hong Kong. You'll also get a chance to grab a glimpse of Ocean Park in the distance while in this area and if keen, make the effort to check it out.
