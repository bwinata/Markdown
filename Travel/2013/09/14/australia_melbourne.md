# Melbourne, Australia #

Without a doubt, Melbourne hosts probably one of, if not, the best active and vibrant coffee scenes in Australia. If you, in any way love your caffeine and will not under any circumstances let anything get in the way between you and your daily (more so than others) hit, then this city is just for YOU!

First things first. Don't expect the coffee to come to you. You need to actively look for these places around the city, although with the shear number of cafes around, just let your nose do the smelling and let your body do the following...

The great thing about the burrows of Melbourne is that there are so many places where good coffee lies, you just have to turn a corner and you'll find yourself in a cool little establishment serving a fresh cup of joe and a delicious breakfast on the side. It should be worth noting, that not all the best places can be found so easily. With just a little push in the right direction down that alley way, along that corridor, up those stairs...you'll be amazed at  what you can find.

Here are a just few places that are definitely worth hitting up while your down there. Most of these places are within walking distance, so get those legs moving and try not to take any public transport. Although if you must, you can always hop on the free tram that regularly takes you around the city center.
**Note**: It should be noted, this list is by far not exhausted.

This nice little cafe is a quaint establishment in the inner suburbs of Fitzroy. Located along Brunswick St, it has a place on one of the popular shopping streets of Melbourne. Situated on the corner of Bell St, from afar, the place is somewhat inconspicuous with its dark curtains, but walk closer and you'll begin to observe people coming in and out of this place all day long along with their classic red coloured outdoor tables.
The coffee in question is without a doubt magnificent, but interestingly enough, what gets me drawn to this cafe is the interior. Walking in, you're greeted with a nice ambience of European flavour with a touch of 19th century nostalgia. To top it off, the breakfast menu is definitely an added plus with your coffee which are served by friendly staff.

Fitzroy is located just on the outskirts of the city centre, which is definitely within walking distance. Trams are also available that traverse the entire strip of Brunswick St. While you're there, get a chance to check out the other stores and outlets.

**Hardware Societe**

This French style cafe is a buzz pretty much every morning of the week, with workers grabbing their daily coffee, and the locals enjoying their breakfast. This place is located along the narrow lane of Hardware Street. Take a mental note to get their early, because they do fill up quite quickly, otherwise you'll have to join the queue.

Hardware Societe in no way looks old fashioned, nostalgic or retro, but is quite modern, with a plenty of interior colour to wake you up in the morning, from the chairs and tables to the pastries on sale. The atmosphere is cosy with some tables providing shared seating with strangers, but don't get put off, it's a great way to meet new people and chat about anything really. Again, the coffee is excellent, but please order more than that if seating in; remember other people will be waiting in the queue to be seated who will be most likely ordering more than a cappuccino.

Here's a breakfast option to get your taste buds going. Come on, you know you want it! Located in the city centre, walking is the best option if you're in that area.

Remember to pay close attention to the street signs, otherwise you'll miss it!
