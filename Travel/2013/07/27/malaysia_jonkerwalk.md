Because we visited Singapore, which is in (relative) close proximity to Malaysia, it made sense that we would cross over and visit Malaysia at some point during our trip. I visited Kuala Lumpur back in 2008, so this time we decided to visit Malacca (Malay: Melaka) for a weekend. Malacca is a small Malaysian state which is located in the southern region of Malaysia, next to the Straits of Malacca.

For this trip, we went with Yee Tours & Transport Services (yeetravels@gmail.com), recommended by family members. Our tour guides Mr Yee and Josephine were really friendly and helpful, and knew all the right places to take us!

One of our first stops was Baba Charlie Nyonya Cake shop. Nyonya (Peranakan Straits Chinese) cuisine is really unique, with influences including Chinese, Malaysian and Indonesian cuisines. This particular cake shop specialises in Nyonya "kueh", which is a type of Malaysian dessert that is steamed rather than baked or fried. They had many different types of kueh, as can be seen in the photo to the left.

We stayed at Hotel Equatorial, which is a short distance from all the shops and Jonker Walk.

Jonker Walk is a street in Chinatown which during the day has many shops selling antiques, textiles and souvenirs. On Friday nights (6 - 10pm) and weekends (11am - 10pm), the roads are closed, replaced by a crowded market which sells food jewellery, souvenirs and interesting trinkets, at bargain prices.
