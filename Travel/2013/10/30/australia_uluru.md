# Uluru & Kings Canyon, Australia #

After doing a whole lot of traveling overseas, it was time to take a trip around my own country. Despite having been born in Australia, I never took it upon myself to explore the greater part of my homeland. Sure, I've been to the more populous cities i.e. Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Hobart. But having traveled so often into the most remote places in countries abroad such as Vietnam, China etc. the irony of not exploring these very same facets within my own country seemed all too wrong and inadequate.

As such, we packed our bags and set off to the center of Australia - Uluru, Northern Territory (NT). With only a 3 hour flight from Sydney, the convenience of air travel made it much more convenient to spend a few days there and see what it was all about. Despite the relative short flight, you really get a sense of how far you've traveled whilst looking out of your window on the plane, with a transition from immense skyscrapers and foliage to a flat, barren, red desert. It felt truly like a world away from home.

Landing in Uluru on the dirt tarmac, you can see the key landmarks before even getting off the plane with Ayers Rock to one side of the fuselage and another set of rocks (Kata Tjuta) on the other.

Generally speaking, the NT is quite hot and dry all year around averaging around 35 degrees Celsius. So it's advised to bring appropriate clothing. During certain times of the year, the area can receive quite a bit of rainfall (if you're lucky), so again, dress [appropriately](http://www.uluru.com/UluruClimate.html).

There are basically three modes of transport you can take whilst in Uluru - Car, Coach (Bus) or walk. We preferred not to take the latter, but if you want to have the freedom and convenience of traveling at your own discretion, hiring a car is the best option. The local airport (Connellan), comes equipped with all the car hiring services available. Best to book in advance seeing as on the spot hires are rare during peak season. Also, be prepared to be driving quite a bit, so make sure that you take adequate breaks when needed. Moreover, fuel doesn't come cheap in this area hovering around $AUD2.26 per liter (unleaded).

As soon as we landed, it was time to grab the car and hit the road. Our first stop was Kings Canyon, located around 360 km north of Uluru. The trip to the canyon is alone worth the drive, as you'll get to see a lot of which makes the center of Australia so unique from anywhere else in the world. On the way, we also made an effort to stop off some of the cattle stations to rest and grab some refreshments. Our first pit stop was Curtis Springs Station.

The bar here, is quite quaint and quirky, so be sure to grab a cool drink while you're there. Also, if you like a bit of novelty, make sure to purchase the $20 Port available. The taste and the label itself is enough to warrant a buy.

While you're there, be sure to grab a few shots of cool looking Table Top Mountain in the distance.

Onwards...

Fast forward a couple of hours and we've finally arrived at [Kings Canyon Resort](http://www.kingscanyonresort.com.au/). Getting there around dusk, we got the chance of witnessing the sunset over the canyon.

Word to the wise, bring insect repellant or purchase a fly net to guard you against the bugs.

With only spending a night there, it was time to head off once again back to Uluru, but before, we wouldn't be doing justice to Kings Canyon if we didn't do a little bit of exploring. If you like a good hike and getting off the beaten track, be sure to check out two hiking trails; Kings Canyon Walk (6 Km, 3.5 hours return) or Kings Creek Walk (2.6 Km, 1 hour return). It's definitely worth the effort and will be sure to get your legs working.

Finishing the Kings Canyon Walk took us to lunch time, which meant it was time to grab a bite. Driving further down the main road (36 Km), takes us to Kings Creek Station. Covering around 2000 Square Kilometers, the station is one of the largest in Australia. Stopping off here, you really do get a good sense of the Australian Outback. Hitting the cafe, the burgers are delicious with a few standouts; Kangaroo and Camel. Unlike the norm, these two are healthy and quite lean with striking similarities to lamb. The usual, beef and chicken are also available.

With only a few hours left to dusk, it was time to head back down to Uluru and catch a glimpse of the sunset over Ayers Rock.

If you have the time and the motivation, make an effort to explore the rock itself. Ayers Rock along with the Olgas (Kata Tjuta) are situated in the National Park which requires a paid pass for access. A 3 day pass will set you back $AUD25 per person giving you unlimited access to the park over that period. The walk around Ayers rock is 10km long and roughly takes 2 hours to complete, while the Olgas will take slightly longer due to changing elevation throughout the hike. Best to go either at dawn or dusk during cooler periods of the day for both sites.

Whatever you choose to do, make sure that you bring plenty of fluids along to ensure that you're properly hydrated and remember to slop yourself with adequate sunscreen. The last thing you want is to suffer from severe dehydration, heat exhaustion or worse, heat stroke. So have fun, take care of yourself and most importantly, explore as much as you can. It's an amazing world out there.
