Yogakarta is located to the east of the capital Jakarta on the island of Java. It's about an hour flight from the capital city and showcases a complete contrast to that of Jakarta.

Jakarta is bustling, noisy, congested and polluted, which is an interesting city to explore in its own right, but if you want to get out and explore something more culturally adept, Yogakarta is to place to hit up. Personally, if you ever make it to Indonesia, and you only have a few days at your disposal, make an effort to have at least this place on your list. It will definitely surprise and inspire you to say the least. It's the city that has stood the test of time, and has virtually protected itself from the onslaught of shopping malls and high-rise buildings that has now plagued the capital city. Yogakarta is quieter, relaxing, calm and most importantly a city baked in immense history.

Okay, so you've just arrived and you have a couple of days to spend, what do you do?

Find somewhere to stay, accommodation all across Indonesia is pretty damn cheap. The place we stayed at was located near the city center - [Ruma Mertua](http://www.rumahmertua.com/). At around $USD 37 a night for a standard room, how can you go wrong! Facilities were fantastic, and the staff were incredibly hospitable. Once settled in, don't get too comfortable, because it's now time to explore.

If you have the chance of exploring one thing while here, be sure it hit up the world heritage listed Borobudur. Now I know that this is probably the most "touristy" place in the area, but you just can't deny that it's age, dating back to the 9th century, steeped in Buddhist and Hindu religion is arguably a wonder of the world. Now, be prepared for the inevitable swarm of tourists and traps that will approach you on your way to the monument, but be strong and keep dodging until the cows come home. Tip - keep walking!

The monument itself is quite spectacular, symmetrical on all four sides with hundreds of Stupas, strategically placed in a linear fashion. Be sure to take plenty of photos, because the view from the top is amazing! What you'll see from above is plenty of foliage, much different to that of the nation's capital.

If you love Borodudur and can't get enough, there's plenty more to see at another Hindu site - Pramabanan. Similarly, a UNESCO, world heritage site. This site dates back to the 9th century and was constructed as an expression to the three Hindu Gods; Brahma (Creator), Vishnu (Preserver) and Shiva (Destroyer).

Apart from Borodudur, be sure to explore other areas of the city's heritage and culture. Within the city itself, you can check out "Kraton" (The Sultan's Palace). The complex is quite large and offers a lot of insight into the city's political and reigning history - if you're that sort of person. Again, be weary of the traditional tourist traps.

The city in general, is quite easy to navigate. Just have a handy map ready and be sure to bargain your way with Taxi drivers. Unlike, the capital, Yogakarta isn't plagued with massive shopping malls, so if you're in the mood for some shopping or want to grab a bite to eat, Marliboro district is the place to go.
